## Section 1: Proportion of G/G in a population

Downloaded a CSV file from Ensemble
<https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Sample?db=core;r=17:39895045-39895145;v=rs8067378;vdb=variation;vf=959672880#373531_tablePanel>

Here we read this CSV file

``` r
mxl <-read.csv("373531-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
head (mxl)
```

Now let’s look at a different population. I picked the GBR.

``` r
gbr <- read.csv("373522-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
```

Find proportion of GIG

``` r
round(table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(gbr) * 100, 2)
```


      A|A   A|G   G|A   G|G 
    25.27 18.68 26.37 29.67 

This variant that is associated with childhood asthma is more frequent
in the GBR populatio than the BKL population.

Let’s now dig into this further.

## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis \[OPTIONAL\]

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a
population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a
population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the
normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is
any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378…) on ORMDL3
expression.

How many samples do we have?

``` r
expr <- read.table("genotype.txt")
head(expr)
```

       sample geno      exp
    1 HG00367  A/G 28.96038
    2 NA20768  A/G 20.24449
    3 HG00361  A/A 31.32628
    4 HG00135  A/A 34.11169
    5 NA18870  G/G 18.25141
    6 NA11993  A/A 32.89721

``` r
nrow(expr)
```

    [1] 462

``` r
table(expr$geno)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

Let’s make a box pot

``` r
ggplot(expr) + 
  aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

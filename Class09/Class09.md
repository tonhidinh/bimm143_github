## Background

In this mini-project, you will explore FiveThirtyEight’s Halloween Candy
dataset.

We will use lots of **ggplot** some basic stats, correlation analysis
and PCA to make sense of the landscape of US candy - something hopefully
more relateable than the proteomics and transcriptomics work that we
will use these methods on throughout the rest of the course.

## Data Input

Our data is a CSV file so we use `read.csv()`

``` r
candy <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy (other than Twix) in the dataset and
> what is it’s winpercent value?

``` r
library(dplyr)
```


    Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

        filter, lag

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
candy |> filter(row.names(candy) == "Sour Patch Kids") |>
  select(winpercent)
```

                    winpercent
    Sour Patch Kids     59.864

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

``` r
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 76.7686

**I prefer this format because it’s shorter than loading the library()**

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

``` r
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 49.6535

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes. The winpercent column has values that are beyond the 0-1 scale that
the other columns have.

``` r
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> `candy$chocolate` column?

In the `candy$chocolate` column, the 0 represents FALSE, meaning that
the candy is does NOT contain chocolate. The 1 in the column represents
TRUE, hence the candy does contain chocolate.

## Exploratory Analysis

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](Class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy, aes(x = winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "navy", color = "maroon") +
  labs(
    x = "Candy Win %",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Candy Win Percentage")
```

![](Class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is above 50%

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 50.31676

``` r
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
      22.45   39.14   47.83   50.32   59.86   84.18 

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

1.  Find all chocolate candy
2.  Get their winpercent values
3.  Find the mean
4.  Find all fruit candy
5.  Get their winpercent values
6.  Find the mean
7.  Compare the two means

On average, chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruit candy

``` r
choc.candy <- candy[candy$chocolate == 1, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
fruit.candy <- candy[candy$fruity == 1, ]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

    [1] 44.11974

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

This difference is statistically significant

``` r
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  choc.win and fruit.win
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:

    sample estimates:

The 2 variables that are anti-correlated are chocolate and fruity.

The 2 variables that are most positively correlated are chocolate and
bar.

The variables that are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive
direction are “fruity”, “pluribus”, and “hard”. Yes, this does make
sense. PC1 separates the fruity, hard, sugary, and non-chocolate candies
from the chocolate candies. The positive loadings are hard, fruit
candies, whereas the negative loadings describe chocolate bars
(e.g. chocolate, bar, caramel, nougat, etc.). This relationship was
previously highlighted in the correlation structure where chocolate and
fruity were the most anti-correlated pair. Hard candies also tended to
be non-chocolate, which was denoted by PC1. This was also evident in the
PCA scatter plot where fruity candies were clustered on one side of PC1
and chocolate was clustered on the opposite side. PC1 visually separates
the candy types in the same way the loading plots above explain
numerically.

To make a “winning” candy, it must be chocolate-based, include caramel,
nougat, or nuts, and come bar-shaped. They are not fruity, hard, or
pluribus, and skew slightly higher in pricepercent. Exploratory plots
showed that these candies (e.g. chocolate bars) were more likely to be
clustered at the top of winpercent, whereas fruity/hard candies were
clustered farther away. The correlation matrix revealed strong positive
correlations between chocolate, bar, caramel, and peanutyalmondy traits,
and a strong negative correlation with fruity and hard candies. PCA
loadings grouped chocolate, bar, caramel, nougat, and nuts on the
opposite side of fruity/hard candies. This indicates that through
visualization, correlation, and PCA analyses, chocolate bar with
caramel/nougat/nuts with a slightly premium price makes a “winning”
candy.
